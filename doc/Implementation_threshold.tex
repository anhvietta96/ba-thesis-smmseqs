\subsubsection{Assumption of uniformly distributed amino acids}
In order to approximate an appropriate threshold $k$ for a $q$-gram environment, a distribution of pairwise amino acid scores is generated. This distribution is then convoluted with itself $q-1$ times to create a distribution of unsorted-$q$-grams-vs-unsorted-$q$-grams score and the threshold can be then obtained by filtering only a fraction of the top scores.

\subsubsection{Approximating threshold from target distribution}
This approach could then be easily adapted for any given target amino acid distribution, where the expected probability of the $q$-grams is integrated into the distribution of the pairwise amino acid scores.
