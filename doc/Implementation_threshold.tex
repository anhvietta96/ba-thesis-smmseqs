In order to approximate an appropriate threshold $k$ for a $q$-gram environment, a distribution of single character score is generated. This distribution is then convoluted with itself $q-1$ times to create a distribution of unsorted-$q$-grams-vs-unsorted-$q$-grams score and the threshold can be easily obtained by filtering only a fraction at the top. This acceptance rate is a predefined preprocessor constant and can be found in $settings.hpp$
