Internally the spaced seed is stored and represented as a 64-bit constant integer. The first step to process this spaced seed is a conversion to a bitset. Its span could then be determined as the length of the bitset subtracted by the position of the most significant 1-bit and its weight is then obtained by iterating over its span.

The program also creates a scheme to divide the spaced seed. The position of the heavier primary environments (if any) is placed at the earlier portion of the spaced seed.

In order to prepare for the recursive hashing of the target sequences, the spaced seeds are also divided in $b$ blocks of smaller $q$-grams. The complexity of the recursive hashing of a sequence of length $n$ is $O(nb)$.
