The calculated elements are wrapped as an instance of $struct$ $LocalEnvType$, which has the following members: a 64-bit numeric value $position$ representing the corresponding position in the original sequence, an 8-bit value of the score and an STL array representing the shuffled $q$-gram.

After the full sequence is processed, the member function reset() should be called to empty the vector, freeing unneeded memory.
