 In MMseqs2, an additional ungapped alignment stage was introduced, where many target sequences are aligned at once using a vectorized approach. It also utilizes a linear memory access using a score matrix containing the p. Due to the extensive use of SIMD instructions, this stage achieves a linear time complexity, much more efficient compared to the Smith-Waterman alignment stage.
